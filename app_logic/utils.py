#
# Purpose:
#   Provides utility functions for network operations and secure file path handling
#   across the Codeprinter application.
#
# Design Intent:
#   - **Reusability**: Groups general-purpose helpers for use in multiple modules.
#   - **Security**: Implements `safe_path` to prevent directory traversal attacks.
#   - **Flexibility**: Enables dynamic port selection for development environments.
#
# How It Works:
#   - **find_open_port**:
#     1. Starts at `start_port` (default 5000).
#     2. Attempts to bind a socket, incrementing the port until successful or `max_tries` is reached.
#     3. Raises an error if no port is available.
#   - **safe_path**:
#     1. Constructs an absolute path from `base_path` and `rel_path`.
#     2. Verifies the path stays within `base_path` to block traversal.
#     3. Returns the resolved path or raises an error.
#
# Integration with Broader Repo:
#   - **app.py**: Uses `find_open_port` to select a free port for the Flask server.
#   - **routes.py**: Employs `safe_path` in `file_contents` for secure local file access.
#   - Enhances security and usability, aligning with Codeprinterâ€™s goal of safe codebase exploration.
#
# Notes:
#   - `find_open_port` is ideal for development; production may use a fixed port.
#   - `safe_path` uses `Path.resolve()` to normalize paths, handling symlinks safely.
